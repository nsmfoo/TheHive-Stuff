# TheHive-Stuff
A collection of scripts for the TheHive

These scripts are not perfect.. they all work, but would need some futher development.. perhaps

- CANARY2Alert - Push Canary alerts into TheHive
- CVE2Alert - Use CVE Search as the base and search in one or several vulnerablity managment systems for any "hits"
- RSS2Alert - Keep track of "security" news in the form of TheHive Alerts
- Rapid7 - A Rapid7 analyzer, search for information about a host or IP
